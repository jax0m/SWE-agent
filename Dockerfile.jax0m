# -------------------------------------------------------
# Issue: 
    # While install does complete there are unresolved issues with placement of
    # some of the folders/other scripts/configs that cause errors on runs without
    # doing some modifications. Was able to temporarily (not cleanly) corret for the moment
    # see "temp solution"

    # TBD code that I had intended to keep active to:
        # run install
        # install frontend
        # switch to named user (then run things ;P )
        # Code:
            # RUN pip install .
            # RUN cd sweagent/frontend && npm install
            # Switch to the 'sweagent'
            # USER sweagent


    # Error when attempting to run "sweagent --help" returns:
        #Traceback (most recent call last):
        #    File "/usr/local/bin/sweagent", line 5, in <module>
        #      from sweagent.run.run import main
        #    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sweagent/__init__.py", line 30, in <module>
        #      assert CONFIG_DIR.is_dir(), CONFIG_DIR
        #  AssertionError: /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/config

    # Temp fix (ran in "/app", essentially the scripts appear to be calling to parents that dont exist as they are outside of sweagent folder):
        # cp -r assets/ /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/assets # Probably not needed was just being lazy
